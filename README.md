Colorteller
===========
ColorTeller uses color keywords to send google as queries to search and scrape resulting websites and grab passages related to these colors and displays it on the screen. It cna be imported to Eclipse to run. 

The software is built in Processing in 2007 while I was a student at NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program.
