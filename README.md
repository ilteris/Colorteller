Colorteller
===========
ColorTeller is a project that shows you quotes from web pages according to the
colors that you wear. Ideally this piece is installed in a room with a projector
and a camera. The motion tracking camera senses and calculates the color of the
audience and sends this information to the custom built software. This
information, then, with the help of this custom software sent to google and
parsed through different web pages. Finally, sentences from those pages which
are related to colors are displayed on the screen in different typographical
ways.

The software is built in Processing in 2006.
